# Automatic-Room-Lighting-System-using-8051-Microcontroller
This project utilizes an 8051 Microcontroller and Infrared (IR) sensors to create an Automatic Room Lighting System with a Bidirectional Visitor Counter. The system automatically controls room lights based on human movement and counts the number of people entering and leaving the room.

Components:

    AT89C51 Microcontroller
    8051 Development Board
    2 x Infrared Sensors
    16 x 2 LCD Display
    5V Relay Module
    Lamp
    Connecting Wires
    Power Supply

This project serves a dual purpose by efficiently managing room lighting and keeping track of visitor counts. The provided components and their connections enable users to implement this system effectively.
