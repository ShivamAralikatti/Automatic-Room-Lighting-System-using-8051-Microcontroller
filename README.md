# Automatic-Room-Lighting-System-using-8051-Microcontroller
This 8051 Microcontroller-based project uses Infrared sensors to create an energy-efficient room lighting system. It detects human movement, automatically turning lights on or off. Simultaneously, it serves as a bidirectional visitor counter, keeping track of individuals entering and leaving the room.
